This is a small practical textbook teaching building blocks for road
safety research. See the rendered book, which is fully open access
thanks to financial support from the RAC Foundation, at

To reproduce the contents of the book, clone the repo, e.g.Â with the
following command after installing the GitHub CLI tool:

``` sh
gh repo clone ITSLeeds/rrsrr
```

or [download](https://github.com/ITSLeeds/rrsrr/archive/master.zip) the
source code from GitHub. Open the folder with an IDE such as RStudio, VS
Code, or Positron, and run the following commands:

``` r
# install dependencies (also see the DESCRIPTION file)
remotes::install_github("itsleeds/rrsrr")
# Install quarto (also requires the system dependency Quarto - see https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
